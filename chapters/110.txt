Chapter 110: Victory's Combo Feels Chilling

Ning Zhuo occasionally came up behind Ning Chen or Ning Yong, placing his hand on their backs to help them manipulate the Sharp Advancement Needle, thereby opening various qi meridians ahead of time. 

Both were behind Ning Zhuo in terms of cultivation, and many of their qi meridians were still unopened. 

Ning Zhuo had long since reached the peak of the third layer and had now broken through to the fourth layer. 

He was very familiar with these qi meridians, akin to a local guiding outsiders. 

The Ice Light Reinforcement Talisman and the Sharp Advancement Needle formed a very ingenious combination. 

Newly opened qi meridians were still weak and unstable. 

At this moment, applying the Ice Light Reinforcement Talisman could stabilize them, saving cultivators a lot of subsequent nurturing and conditioning effort.

Soon, both Ning Chen and Ning Yong made breakthroughs! 

Ning Zhuo monitored them closely, constantly providing guidance. 

At first, the new energy flow paths were difficult for Ning Chen and Ning Yong to operate. 

However, Ning Zhuo secretly manipulated the Life Thread to directly control their bodies, adjusting their breathing and optimizing their rhythm. 

Simultaneously, he also used a trace of the power from his Buddha Heart Demon Seal to guide their thoughts, ensuring they didn't realize the truth and instead believed that Ning Zhuo was simply an excellent teacher and that they were learning well.

Cultivators have a daily limit to how much energy they can absorb. 

Ning Chen reached his limit first, followed shortly by Ning Yong. Only then did Ning Zhuo withdraw his hand from their backs. 

"Rest and adjust your breaths. I'll be waiting outside," he said before stepping out of the cultivation chamber.

Not long after, Ning Chen and Ning Yong emerged, looking exhausted. 

Ning Chen, leading the way, bowed deeply to express his gratitude for Ning Zhuo's guidance. 

Ning Yong, scratching his head, couldn't match Ning Chen's eloquence but simply said, "I feel the same way!" Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, dismissing it as a small matter.

Ning Chen, with a serious expression, bowed deeply, "If you ever need anything, Brother Ning Zhuo, just say the word." 

Ning Zhuo nodded and smiled, noting that Ning Chen was perceptive, unlike Ning Yong. Ning Yong, catching on, quickly added, "I mean it too!" 

Ning Zhuo then said, "In fact, there's something I could use your help with right now." 

Relieved, Ning Chen quickly asked what it was.

Ning Zhuo explained that he needed them to go to the Monkey Head Gang's headquarters to find the current leader, Yuan Er.

Yuan Er sat at the head of the hall, with numerous gang elders engaged in heated discussions below. 

Their voices were loud, and during arguments, they often banged the table, cursed, and competed to see who could shout the loudest.

The once solemn council chamber of the Su Building now resembled a chaotic marketplace. 

Yuan Er's face was ashen. Without Yuan Dasheng to back him up, the elders had become unruly! 

Yuan Er couldn't get a word in edgewise; he felt like a puppet, sitting in the main seat but with no respect from anyone. 

Ostensibly, the elders were arguing, but in reality, they were watching Yuan Er's reactions. 

Yuan Er could clearly feel his already meager authority quickly crumbling.

"What should I do? Who can help me?"

Perhaps hearing Yuan Er's inner plea, Ning Chen and Ning Yong were led in by members of the gang. 

Ning Chen wore a serious expression, while Ning Yong strode in confidently, taking the lead. 

Upon entering the council chamber, he loudly declared, "Yuan Er, our young master has matters to discuss with you." 

The chamber fell silent. 

The gang elders turned their heads to look at the two young Qi Refinement cultivators, their gazes converging on the identity badges at their waists.

Ning Family?!

A flash of delight crossed Yuan Er's eyes. Slowly standing up, he carefully chose his words, "Does Master Ning Zhuo have business with me?"

Ning Chen nodded, "Indeed. We request the gang leader to step aside so we can discuss in detail."

"Of course, of course." Yuan Er was already feeling out of place, like sitting on pins and needles. 

This was the best way to conclude the meeting.

"Please, this way." Yuan Er gestured. Ning Chen walked ahead, and before leaving, Ning Yong nonchalantly waved to the gang elders, "Continue, keep discussing." 

The elders were no longer as heated as before. Though they continued their discussion, each of them was now distracted.

"When did Yuan Er connect with the Ning Family?"

"Who is Young Master Ning Zhuo? Never heard of him."

"Check this out when we get back!"

Yuan Er led Ning Chen and Ning Yong to a side room. 

Upon learning that they were there to collect all of Yuan Dasheng's old belongings, he was puzzled.

"Why?" Yuan Er asked, confused.

Ning Chen then presented the explanation given by Ning Zhuo, "Young Master Ning Zhuo keeps his promises and values his word. He will personally craft the mechanical monkey for you, putting in his utmost effort. Since the main material is Yuan Dasheng's body, the created mechanical monkey should emulate Yuan Dasheng's fighting habits to better utilize the superior qualities of the materials."

Yuan Er found this very reasonable and nodded repeatedly, "Yes, that makes sense."

"Uncle Dasheng was skilled in close combat, his bones honed through countless battles and fights, perfectly attuned to his martial arts. I'll gather all the footage of Uncle Dasheng during his lifetime for Master Ning's reference. As for his personal belongings, are they really necessary?"

Ning Chen shook his head. "Yes, this is Young Master Ning Zhuo's specific instruction. Creating a mechanical monkey is akin to composing poetry; it requires inspiration. Think of the mechanical monkey as a poetic tribute to Yuan Dasheng. Young Master Ning Zhuo needs to understand Yuan Dasheng's essence through these personal items and various materials to create a more fitting tribute. It would be best to collect everything related to Yuan Dasheng and send it to us. The more comprehensive the collection, the better the final product."

Yuan Er nodded repeatedly. "I understand, I understand!"

These days had been tough for him, and the future looked even bleaker. No one would anticipate the mechanical monkey more than Yuan Er.

"Though Uncle Dasheng is no longer with us, in another form, he will continue to support and protect me and maintain the entire Monkey Head Gang!"

Ning Chen and Ning Yong completed their task perfectly. 

They brought back numerous items closely associated with Yuan Dasheng. 

Ning Zhuo collected these to supplement the spiritual essence of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng. 

According to the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, all things possess spiritual essence. 

Strong spiritual essence tends to disperse outward, so personal items often absorb related spiritual essence.

Some belongings of great cultivators, after long periods of use, often develop a bit of sentience. 

Although Yuan Dasheng was not a great cultivator, he hadn't been dead for long, so his belongings still carried some of his spiritual essence. 

Since this essence is from the same source, it is highly efficient for replenishment. 

This was the most feasible solution for Ning Zhuo at present.

"Next, I'll train the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra and then find an opportunity to refine these items to extract their spiritual essence. 

Apart from the issue of spiritual essence, the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng, also needs better repairs." 

Ning Zhuo also needed to consider how to handle the aftermath if the Zhou family discovered the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng.

"Hmm?"

Ning Chen checked the jade slip provided by Yuan Er. 

The slip contained footage of Dasheng's martial arts training and combat scenes, which broadened Ning Zhuo's horizons. 

Particularly impressive was a set of combo moves used by Yuan Dasheng during battles.

When encountering a strong enemy, Da Sheng would pretend to be outmatched and flee. 

As the enemy pursued closely, he would suddenly squat down, extend his hand backward, and make a downward scooping motion. 

At that moment, his arm seemed to stretch, always hitting the opponent.

This was a martial art that Yuan Da Sheng gradually comprehended and perfected through real combat in alleyways and beast fights—Backhand Grab. 

In the recorded footage, Yuan Da Sheng, now middle-aged, had developed another martial art technique—Shattering Sun Hand! 

He practiced Shattering Sun Hand by first crushing wooden balls, then stone balls, and eventually iron and steel balls, progressing step by step. 

The offensive power was terrifying, making Ning Zhuo feel a chill down his spine as he watched.

Ning Zhuo marveled, “First, the Backhand Grab, and then the Shattering Sun Hand. The two martial arts techniques form a combo, filled with a ruthless and sinister style. Yuan Dasheng truly earned his place through brutal battles from the very bottom; it’s so grounded in reality!”

An idea struck him, “Perhaps, when I repair Yuan Dasheng, I can use this direction for modification. Once it has abundant spiritual essence, it might even replicate these once-proud combo moves.”

Just the thought of it filled Ning Zhuo with great anticipation.
